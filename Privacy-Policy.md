# Privacy Notice
This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for Citable and Printable Chrome extensions, sites. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by these sites. It will notify you of the following:
1. What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.
2. The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
3. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

## Information Collection, Use, and Sharing
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to log data. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.

### Log Data
Like many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site ("Log Data").

This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics. We never collect the content of notes or information about the sites users visit.

In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this log data.

### Google Analytics
We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so. We also collect statistics about which actions users take. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.

Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use (as amended for government websites) and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.

### Security
We take precautions to protect your information. Sensitive information is only transmitted between the Chrome Extension on your computer and with Google servers.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online. Within the Chrome Extension, information is stored in Javascript memory and local storage. While Chrome protects this information from being accessed by software other than Citable, this information is still potentially vulnerable.

### Your Access to and Control Over Information
If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via the Chrome Webstore listings. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jfiabcklnnhkmkcdjjpmgghiimjkaeio
